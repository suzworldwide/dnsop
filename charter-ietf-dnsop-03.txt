The DNS Operations Working Group will develop guidelines for the
operation of DNS software servers and the administration of DNS zones.
These guidelines will provide technical information
relating to the implementation of the DNS protocol by the
operators and administrators of DNS zones. The group will
perform the following activities:

1. Define the processes by which Domain Name System (DNS) software
   may be efficiently and correctly administered, configured, and
   operated on Internet networks. This will include root zone
   name servers, gTLD name servers, name servers for other DNS
   zones, iterative DNS resolvers, and recursive DNS resolvers.
   As part of this effort, the group will produce documents
   explaining to the general Internet community what processes
   and mechanisms should be employed for the effective management
   and operation of DNS software.

2. Publish documents concerning DNSSEC operational procedures.

3. Publish documents concerning the IPv6 DNS operational
   procedures and DNS-related IPv6 transition and coexistence
   issues.

4. Publish documents concerning the operations of the root and
   TLD services, and DNS resolvers.

5. Publish documents on extensions or protocol maintenance to the DNS
   Protocol, with a focus on the operational impacts of
   such changes. Act as clearinghouse or providing advice to ADs
   and other WGs on EDNS0 options, new RRTYPEs, DNSSEC, record
   synthesis, or other mechanics of extending DNS to support other
   applications.

6. Serve as a clearinghouse for DNS-related issues where people can
   bring drafts that document the problem space around these issues.
   The group will then decide whether these issues belong in DNSOP or
   will work with the authors and appropriate ADs to determine the
   appropriate group for the work.

7. Address the problem ares around the top level namespace; manage the
   IETF portion of that registry; and work as a Liason between the
   IETF, the IAB, and ICANN.
