The DNS Operations Working Group will develop guidelines for the
operation of DNS software servers and the administration of DNS zones.
These guidelines will provide technical information relating to the
implementation of the DNS protocol by the operators and administrators
of DNS zones. The group will perform the following activities:

1. Define the processes by which Domain Name System (DNS) software may
be efficiently and correctly administered, configured, and operated on
Internet networks. This will include root zone name servers, gTLD name
servers, name servers for other DNS zones, iterative DNS resolvers,
and recursive DNS resolvers. As part of this effort, the group will
produce documents explaining to the general Internet community what
processes and mechanisms should be employed for the effective
management and operation of DNS software.

2. Publish documents concerning DNSSEC operational procedures.

3. Publish documents concerning the IPv6 DNS operational procedures
and DNS-related IPv6 transition and coexistence issues.

4. Publish documents concerning the operations of the root and TLD
services, and DNS resolvers.
